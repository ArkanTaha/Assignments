# Data Wrangling
Description:

*Create a data frame consists of:
‘first_name’: ??, ‘last_name’: ??, ‘age’: ??, ‘preTestScore’:?? ,’postTestScore’: ??

*Objective: Perform data processing on the raw data.

*Actions to perform:
- Save the data frame into a .csv file as project.csv
- Read the project.csv file and print the data frame.
- Read the project.csv file without column heading.
- Read the project.csv file and make two index columns, namely, ‘First Name’ and ‘Last Name’.
- Print the data frame in a Boolean form as True or False. True for Null/ NaN values and false for non-null values.
- Read the data frame by skipping the first 3 rows and print the data frame.

# Features Reduction - LogisticRegression code covers:
- import libraries and the dataset
- define the data and target values
- split the data and target values into training and testing sets
- implement a logistic regression model
- perform PCA transformation
- implement the logistic regression model over the transformed datasets
- check for the accuracy

# Labelled Feature Reduction code covers:
- import libraries and the dataset
- define the data and target values
- instantiate LDA
- transform the x variables using LDA
